# Hello there!

This is the repository for the SMS or "ShapeManagementSystem", a project I worked on to 
finish 1 week of learning C++. It's a database application of sorts that let's you insert/remove/list
shapes including rectangles, triangles, trapezoids, and circles. 

It makes use of Variables, Logic, OOP, Polymorphism, the C++ Preprocessor, etc

You can build this project as a Visual Studio Solution (with the .sln) or through using cmake.
Sorry macOS and Linux users, but you could probably find a way to build this with g++ on Linux
or clang/Xcode on macOS.

The basic command syntax is:

add: adds a shape
 - rect <width> <height>
 - triangle <base> <height>
 - circle <radius>
 - trapezoid <bottom> <side> <top>

remove: removes a shape by index (visible using list)

list: lists all stored shapes with their properties and index


  
Have fun!
