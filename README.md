# ShapeManagementSystem
An example project I did while learning C++, teaches you about pointers, memory, polymorphism, OOP etc

To be honest, this repo is kind of a mess (sorry!) :)

With Visual Studio 2022 you should be able to import the project with the .sln or through cmake

I didn't try it on Linux/macOS but you could probably get it to work with cmake and g++

Happy Coding!
